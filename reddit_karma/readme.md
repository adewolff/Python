## Reddit Karma analyzer

This project was started as practice in OOP. 

reddit_user.py utilizes the Reddit API to gather information on Reddit users' most recent posts/comments and return it in a useable format.

karma.py currently serves as sample code using reddit_user to compare scores from 2 users' most recent link or comment.
